# Map_Editor

This is a work in progress, to allow us to create maps for Arena.

## Todo checklist:
- [ ] Add 2nd layer to map.
- [ ] Decide and implement an option to determine which tiles are solid within a spritesheet.
- [ ] Add grid display option to the mapViewPanel, to make editing easier.
- [ ] Consider adding a toolbar, and possible mouse icons for different tools.
- [ ] Allow for new map, changing spritesheets.... Especially for different tile sizes :S
